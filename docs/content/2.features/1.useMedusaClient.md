# `useMedusaClient`

---

This composable is using [@medusa/medusa-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@medusajs/medusa-js) under the hood and gives you access to the Medusa client.

Check official documentation of Medusa JS Client to learn more about all available options [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/js-client/overview/)

## Fetching Products

Here is an example of a fetch using the `list` method:

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
  const client = useMedusaClient();
  const { products } = await client.products.list();
</script>
```

## Fetching Collections

Here is an example of a fetch using the `list` method:

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
  const client = useMedusaClient();
  const { collections } = await client.collections.list();
</script>
```

## Authenticating

Authenticating users with `authenticate` method:

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
  const client = useMedusaClient();

  await client.auth.authenticate({ email: 'test@test.test', password: 'test1234' });
</script>
```

This will create a new cookie called `connect.sid` that will have a `httpOnly` flag set to true (which means that it is not accessible from the frontend JS code).

You can now fetch the data about currently logged in user like following:

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
  const client = useMedusaClient();

  const { customer } = await client.auth.getSession()
</script>
```
