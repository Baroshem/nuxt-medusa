# `serverMedusaClient`

---

This server utility is using [@medusa/medusa-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@medusajs/medusa-js) under the hood and gives you access to the Medusa client.

Check official documentation of Medusa JS Client to learn more about all available options [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/js-client/overview/)

## Fetching data from Medusa on the Server

To use the server utility you first need to enable the `server` option in the module configuration like following:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-medusa'],
  medusa: {
    server: true
  }
})
```

Then, let's create a new api endpoint `server/api/products.ts`:

```ts
import { serverMedusaClient } from '#medusa/server'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const client = serverMedusaClient(event)
  const { products } = await client.products.list()

  return { products }
})
```

In here, we are registering a new `eventHandler` that will create a connetion to the Medusa platform and then fetch the product list that can be later returned.

Finally, let's fetch this data in our Vue components by using `$fetch` like following:

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
  const { data } = await useFetch('/api/products')
  const products = data.value.products
</script>
```
